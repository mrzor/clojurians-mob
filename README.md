Greetings, Clojurian !

Would you like to hack open source stuff with other people ?
If the answer is yes, then read on!

### HOWTO Hack Stuff With People
1) Pick stuff
2) Pick people (optional)
3) Pick a time. Please make it public so the swarm might mob you.
4) Pick a way to do it.

Join us for a chat! We're casually populating `#mob-programming` on [Clojurians' Slack](https://clojurians.slack.com).

It will feel much nicer with you around!

### List of projects at least one person is willing to hack on
- [mrzor/httpbis](https://github.com/mrzor/httpbis)
- Building a Mob Programming Website?
- _Your idea Here!_

### List of people

- mrzor, prefers Clojure to Clojurescript for now. lives on the CEST timezone. available some days, from 1700 UTC to 0200 UTC.

### List of ways to do it

- Coding person streams to twitch with or without sound, people hop into teamspeak/discord/mumble to contribute (We'll be adding a setup guide for code streaming in the near future)
- Coding person collects public keys from the mob, gives them shell access to something, and they all hack together inside a screen or tmux session
- Suggestions welcome
