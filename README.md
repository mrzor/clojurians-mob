Greetings, Clojurian !

Would you like to hack open source stuff with other people ?
If the answer is yes, then read on!

### HOWTO Hack Stuff With People
1) Pick stuff
2) Pick people (optional)
3) Pick a time. Please make it public so the swarm might mob you.
4) Pick a way to do it.

Join us for a chat! We're casually populating `#mob-programming` on [Clojurians' Slack](https://clojurians.slack.com).

It will feel much nicer with you around!

### List of projects at least one person is willing to hack on
- [mrzor/httpbis](https://github.com/mrzor/httpbis)
- Building a Mob Programming Website?
- Setting up a MP slack bot
- _Your idea Here!_

### List of ways to do it

- Coding person streams to twitch with or without sound, people hop into teamspeak/discord/mumble to contribute (We'll be adding a setup guide for code streaming in the near future)
- Coding person collects public keys from the mob, gives them shell access to something, and they all hack together inside a screen or tmux session
- Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/mrzor/clojurians-mob/wiki) for more information regarding setting up your own stream using Twitch and OBS.
- Suggestions welcome! Feel free to contribute directly to the wiki and/or update this README.
